# Hip-Hop-Freestyle-Generater
A Natural Language Processing Project. 
In this project, we target on Hip- hop freestyle lyrics generation given spe- cific user-defined keywords. 
Semantic, pho- netic and keyword features are engineered for generation. 
A multi-encoder decoder language model is implemented with atten- tion mechanism. 
Using BERT as encoders and GPT2 as decoders.
